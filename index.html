            <h2>Topic(s) of Interest:</h2>
            <p>A project topic that resonates with me a lot is: Music. It's always been a huge part of my
                life (to get through the hard times or to just jam out). So I would love to give
                back, and create an app relating to this. Some other topics I would like to explore are Food, Maps, and
                Travelling. I really enjoy trying out new types of food and love travelling to explore different
                cultures and
                scenaries.

            <h2>Potential App Ideas:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>DJ Party App</li>
                <li>Music Finder</li>
                <li>Community Sourced Music Playlist</li>
                <li>Map News</li>
                <li>Personalized Recipe Finder</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>More in Detail:</h2>
            <p> I would like to try to make an app that allows a group of people to listen to the same
                music playlist in real time, altogether and synchronized. It would be "useful as" it
                could emulate a private dj party with just your smartphone, the app, your friends, and
                headphones of your choosing. Then, we could have a mini party wherever we are (on campus,
                at gasworks, in paris, etc.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Another app I had in mind was one that could help you find music in a more intuitive way.
                Spotify is what I personally use to find music, but I think there could be a standalone app for purely
                searching music, with better UI / UX. I am not too sure about the specific details, but would love to
                explore this idea. I also use Pandora to search for new music, but the ads, the lack
                of song filters, the lack of ability to skip (unless you pay), and to explore more music manually
                is something that I think could be improved on. Pandora is like a radio, but I would like to make
                an app that is purely on the purpose "music-searching."
            </p>

            <p> The last idea is an app that is a live map that gathers information of the events or news of the
                current area that the user is in. It would be able to inform of recent past events, future events,
                the history of that area, new restaurants nearby, restaurant recommendations, recent crimes, or
                just, in general, interesting facts as you walk around the area. It would be useful in that a stranger
                from the city or the area could be informed about what this place is about. It would be like a
                personalized
                tour guide built right into the app.
