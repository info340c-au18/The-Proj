    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="about-title">About this App:</h1>

        <div class="about-flex">
            <div class="origin text-box" id="origin">
                <h2 class="red-text">Its Origin</h2>
                <p class="white-text">The idea came from a pool of ideas from a brainstorm session. Here's a little
                    sneak
                    to
                    that session: "A project topic that resonates with me a lot is: Music. It's always been a huge part
                    of
                    my
                    life (to get through the hard times or to just jam out). So I would love to give back, and create
                    an
                    app
                    relating to this. Some other topics I would like to explore are Food, Maps, and Travelling. I
                    really
                    enjoy
                    trying out new types of food and love travelling to explore different cultures and scenaries."
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="overview text-box">
                <h2 class="red-text">What Does It Do?</h2>
                <p class="white-text">It is essentially an app that allows a group of people to listen to the
                    same music playlist in real time, altogether and synchronized. It would be "useful as" it could
                    emulate
                    a private dj party with just your smartphone, the app, your friends, and headphones of your
                    choosing.
                    The idea is to have the ability to have a mini party wherever you are (on campus, at Gasworks, in
                    Paris, NYC, Italy, Korea, etc.)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="finished text-box">
                <h2 class="red-text">
                    The Finished Product
                </h2>
                <p class="white-text">Upon the completion of the app, it will allow you to host a DJ session in
                    real-time.
                    The only things that everyone will need are a: charged phone and headphones (the nicer they are,
                    the
                    better
                    the experience will be). The goal is to have an immersed, fun, and epic experience with your
                    friends or
                    even meet new people that have similar music interests!
                    </real-time>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="features text-box" id="features">
                <h2 class="red-text">Its Features</h2>

                <p class="white-text">It will also have a quick navigation of what kind of music you would like to
                    play. It
                    would
                    offer 5 popular genres, 5 different moods, and the top 5 popular songs at that moment. It will also
                    have
                    the ability to search a single song or an album! This would hopefully make it seamless to discover
                    new
                    music as
                    well. The Music Player section will have the typical play, rewind, and forward buttons. And, the
                    album
                    cover
                    will of course be displayed and change when the song's album is different.
